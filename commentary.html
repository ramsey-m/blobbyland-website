    <h1>Mr. Blobby has been described as:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A cybernetic pig demon</li><br />
      <li>A horrific cross spieces breeding experiment gone wrong</li><br />
      <li>The ghost of an 18th centuray pedophile, living in eternal torment for his sins</li><br /><br />
      <li>In March 1994, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times wrote: "Mr Blobby's rise to stardom has provoked anguished commentaries about just what he stands for... Some commentators have called him a metaphor for a nation gone soft in the head.
        Others have seen him as proof of Britain's deep-seated attraction to trash."</li>
