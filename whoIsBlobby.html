    <h1>Who is Mr. Blobby?</h1>
    <p>Mr Blobby is a giant pink creature covered in large yellow spots, with bulbous green eyes and a permanent wide grin. Mr Blobby communicates only by saying the word "blobby" in an electronically altered high pitched screek, expressing his moods through tone of voice and repetition.
    Mr. Blobby is known for his eratic body movements and unpredictible behaviour.</p>
